After completing a master's degree in chemistry from Durham University and spending multiple summers interning
in accountancy, I finally worked out that data science was far more interesting.

Moved into the world of data in my current role at a market research provider to the semiconductor industry.

Interested in all things data. In particular, the application of machine learning to quantitative finance. Currently working towards a MSc in Business Analytics at Imperial College London Business School.

Outside of work in I play hockey, squash and have been known to occasionally run marathons. I am also fairly handy at [waterskiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqTajYkYbEo).
